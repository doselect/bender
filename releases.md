Every project should have releases created whenever we release something that matters (Logs / Documentation changes don't count)

How to create a Release ? Refer [this](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/creating-releases) document

How should the versioning be done ? Read [this](https://semver.org/)

Some guidelines to be followed while writing release notes 

- Use plain language only use technical language if absolutely necessary
- Keep it short and simple (KISS)
- Group things logically 
  eg FIXES, IMPROVEMENTS, NEW FEATURES, etc. 
- Include relevant links like cross issues or Sentry exceptions

When in doubt ask a team-mate.
